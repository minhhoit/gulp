INSTALLATION
------------

After this is complete, follow the instructions given in "GETTING STARTED".

### Install via node && compass


### Install Node

If you're using OS X or Windows, the best way to install Node.js is to use one of the installers from the "Node.js download page":https://nodejs.org/en/download. If you're using Linux, you can use the installer, or you can check "NodeSource's binary distributions":https://github.com/nodesource/distributions to see whether or not there's a more recent version that works with your system.

Test: Run node -v. The version should be higher than v0.10.32.

You can then install the packages dependencies using the following command:
~~~
npm install
~~~

GETTING STARTED
---------------

After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1. Run command `init` to initialize the application with a specific environment.
- compass config --sass-dir=sass --css-dir=css --javascript-dir=js
- compass init
2. Run command `gulp` to initialize the static file for the application
